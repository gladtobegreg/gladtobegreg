Hi! I'm Gregory.

As a recent nyc graduate, my passion for software engineering is launching me full swing into the ever shifting field of tech.
I'm excited to work alongside teams and persons who are growing and building themselves upwards. With innovation and learning
at the forefront of software engineering space, my life long passion for technology has no limits. Ultimately, I want to engage
with other professionals, build compelling solutions and become an expert in the field of computer science.

At Queens College, we lay the groundwork for a strong foundation in computer science; building skills in development,
data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, database systems, networks, engineering, and machine learning.
We explored many concepts and tools, all critical for any skilled professional to practice and explore. Languages, tools,
and platforms that I become familiar with at QC include: Java, Python, C/C++, JavaScript, SQL, NodeJS, VS Code, IntelliJ,
Eclipse, JUnit, Git, Docker, Azure, Erwin DM, MySQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL and many more.

I am currently interested in excersizing my abilities to build projects that might explore new technologies and build
effective solutions to interesting problems. That means learning to program in new languages, studying existing methods,
and refining my skills to become a better candidate for a role in software engineering.

This GitHub will act a hub for my works to be accessible to any potential employers, curious minds, and upcoming learners.
Please reach out to me if you think I might be a good fit for your team or just want to discuss anything tech.
Thank you for taking the time to visit and read up on my ideas and aspirations.
