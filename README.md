Hi! I'm Gregory.

As a recent NYC graduate, my passion for software engineering is launching me into the ever-shifting field of software and technology. I'm excited to work alongside teams and individuals who are growing and building themselves upward. With innovation and learning at the forefront of the software engineering space, my lifelong passion for technology has no limits. Ultimately, I want to engage with other professionals, build compelling solutions, and become an expert in the field of computer science.

At Queens College, we lay the groundwork for a strong foundation in computer science by building skills in development, data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, database systems, networks, engineering, and machine learning. We explored many concepts and tools, all critical for any skilled professional to practice and explore. Languages, tools, and platforms that I became familiar with at QC include: Java, Python, C/C++, JavaScript, SQL, NodeJS, VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse, JUnit, Git, Docker, Azure, Erwin DM, MySQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL, and many more.

I am currently interested in exercising my abilities to build projects that might explore new technologies and build effective solutions to interesting problems. That means learning to program in new languages, studying existing methods, and refining my skills to become a better candidate for a role in software engineering.

This GitHub will act as a hub for my work to be accessible to any potential employers, curious minds, and upcoming learners. Please reach out to me if you think I might be a good fit for your team or just want to discuss anything tech. Thank you for taking the time to visit and read up on my ideas and aspirations.
