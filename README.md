# Hi, I'm Greg - A Software Engineer from New York City

## I've been studying tech stacks and web applications to better understand how projects are built and shared. As a computer science graduate, and a tinkerer at heart, technology is an endless learning space to explore. I'm pleased to spend my time developing skills and my knowledge base using new tools and applying new ideas. I'm currently in search of a team to develop and build projects with others.

Within the ever expanding space of technology and software, new solutions and applications are always popping up. Everyday we have more and more tools at our disposal but the sky is the limit. Getting there just takes some work and a healthy dose of creativity. Building effective solutions and learning to work together is the real challenge. I'm happy to say this is where I apply my focus and strive to build a career.

I hope to connect with professionals and companies that may help create opportunities to explore those challenges together.

### My skillset and experience includes the following technologies...

Python, Javascript, Java, C++, HTML/CSS
React, Node.js, Express
MS SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL
Erwin Data Modeler, Docker, Git, ChatGPT
And more
